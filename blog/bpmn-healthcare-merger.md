### How BPMN and Cardanit collaborative features helped the merge of two healthcare companies

Business Process Modeling and Notation is quite a simple standard. People who are not familiar with BPMN elements may also need a description of the diagram of the model implemented during the process analysis. This is why business consultants and analysts tend to share a more readable ‘user manual’, which Cardanit produces at the click of a button, when presenting the results of their work.

Learn how Cardanit helped Michal Breda, Process Modeling Specialist at EUC Premium in the Czech Republic, efficiently streamline the merger process of two healthcare companies. Michal and his team managed to smoothly draw hundreds of BPMN workflows in a very short time. At the same time, using Cardanit collaboration features, and most of all the automated report, Michal’s team shared their results with the different stakeholders from the two companies. All the processes were clearly understood and the Cardanit report became the starting point of their internal Quality Management process document.

The deadline for the merger was 1 April 2021 and Cardanit enabled EUC Premium to:  

* Identify all the processes needed for the merger
* Quickly and efficiently describe the processes of both companies
* Easily integrate them into a unified environment
* Work cooperatively in the description and implementation of the processes
* Comprehensively transfer the entire process system of both companies to a new structure

The context - Process identification {.a-badge .a-badge--primary .a-badge--m .a-badge--blog}

In the middle of 2019, the management of EUC decided to describe all the processes in its subsidiary EUC Premium. About 180 processes have been identified as part of this project, most of which have been described by the end of 2019.

The challenge - Process description {.a-badge .a-badge--primary .a-badge--m .a-badge--blog}

In November, a merger of EUC Premium with another subsidiary, Canadian Medical was announced. It was necessary to describe the processes in this company and to start their integration as part of the merger. At the turn of the year, 80% of Canadian Medical processes were described. 

From January to the end of March 2020, they worked on **integrating the processes of both companies** into a unified environment. Integration was split into several stages depending on the possibilities of integration of information systems. Starting from April 2020, the teams of the two companies have worked together, with an expected completion date of the integration of all the processes by 1 April 2021.

The solution - Cardanit BPMN editor {.a-badge .a-badge--primary .a-badge--m .a-badge--blog}

In Michal Breda’s words, “because we were able to **quickly and efficiently describe the processes** of both companies with the BPMN methodology in the Cardanit environment, it helped to manage the integration of the processes of both companies. These processes were partly different depending on the various information systems, and the graphical models helped all teams understand the processes of the other side and design a common integrated functional system.”

The benefits - Collaboration and report {.a-badge .a-badge--primary .a-badge--m .a-badge--blog}

“During the merge phase, but also during my daily activities, I’ve found very useful all the collaboration features like the **internal chat** and the **share functionality** and most of all, the automated report.”, Michal continues describing his process modeling with Cardanit. 

“We usually set up a meeting in which we describe the process and we start designing the model on a whiteboard. I then draw it in Cardanit and after agreement of the diagram by the cooperating departments **I generate the automated report**. At that point, my colleagues involved in the project add comments under each activity, so we can complete the workflow based on their suggestions.We then transform the Cardanit report into our **Quality Management process document** and publish it on our intranet for common use.”

Michal and his team are now heading towards the completion of the merger process of EUC Premium with Canadian Medical efficiently drawing their processes with the help of Cardanit collaboration features.
